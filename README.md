# FemGRL:FEM-based graph residual learning


## Overview
The open-source Python package FemGRL is a numerical program for solving 2-D optical scattering problems. The program use the inherent consistency between GNN and FEM in data structure, the mesh generated by FEM is mapped into a graph structure.The program is able to compute complex single metal scatterer structures and further generalized to scenarios involving multiple metal scatterers using transfer learning manner.

If you find FemGRL useful for your research, please consider giving a star. Thank you.

## Usage
### Scripts
1. `build_graph`: Constructs graph datasets.
2. `model`: Constructs the network architecture.
3. `trainddp`: Network training module.
4. `config`:Configuration file; sets data loading paths, save locations, preprocessing options, etc.
5. `run`:Invokes the training code, configures the DDP environment, and enables multi-GPU parallelism.
